title: First Post
---

I wanted to start writing a blog since a long time. I like sharing my
knowledge so it seems like a good idea. Time will tell!

Anyway, I'm a programmer so it's natural for me to want to share code
snippets. There are other subjects I want to share about but code
snippets is often the missing feature for blogging tools or services.
Also, I'm an engineer at heart so I like to build things myself. I
searched for some DIY alternatives to online services and found
Hakyll. It seems like the perfect fix because I want to write about a
language I fell in love with, Haskell.

So here we are, this is my first blog post, what can I write about?
Let's talk about how to setup a blog similar to this one. This is my
freshest project anyway.

First caveat, I cannot yet publish this blog post because I've got
nowhere to publish it! It's all local. This blog post will explain how
to setup a Hakyll blog using nix... locally. Next blog post will talk
about how to publish. And then you'll be able to read this, finally.

The stack is Hakyll on top of Haskell and nix. I really like that
development environments setup with nix are fully reproducible. It's
not easy to setup nor to understand how Nix works though, so it's an
investment.
