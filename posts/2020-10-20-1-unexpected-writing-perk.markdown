title: Unexpected Writing Perk
---

It's kind of obvious in retrospective, but I try to pay attention when
I'm writing something on the internet.

For example, sharing my Emacs configuration made me realize I had a
few hacks in place and I felt dirty sharing those. I took some time to
rework the hacks and that resulted in improving my configuration and
making it more maintainable.

The same thing happens when I try to explain an idea to someone or
when I make a presentation at work. I try to explain my ideas in the
most intelligible way possible and that's often when I realize I don't
grasp the idea fully and am unable to explain at least some part of
it.

In other words, writing is like having a [rubber
duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).

Thank you for being my rubber duck.

I hope you will gain something from reading my blog posts. If you do,
or do not, I'd love to hear about it!
