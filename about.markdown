I'm a software engineer interested in distributed programming and
declarative infrastructure as well as IoT electronics and smart home
projects. I'm working at [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) on the
[Next-Gen
Waf](https://www.fastly.com/products/web-application-api-protection)
project, helping secure the web. I'm the father of 5 wonderful
children. I like help my wife in her various home improvement and wood
working projects.
