I'm a software engineer advocate of Self Hosting and Data Sovereignty. I work on [Self Host
Blocks](https://github.com/ibizaman/selfhostblocks) to lower the bar of entry to these domains.

I am interested in **distributed programming** and **declarative infrastructure** as well as **IoT**
electronics and **smart home** projects.

I'm working at [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) on the [Next-Gen
Waf](https://www.fastly.com/products/web-application-api-protection) project, helping secure the
web.

I'm the father of 6 wonderful children and married to a wonderful wife.
